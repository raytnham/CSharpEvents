<h1>C#: EVENT EXAMPLE</h1>

An event is a message sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action. In object-oriented programming, <strong>Events</strong> allow a class or an object to be notified when something interesting occurs. An event can be generated or triggered by the system, the user or in other ways.
